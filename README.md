JavaScript Quiz Game (Browser Console)
 Project Overview

This project is a simple JavaScript Quiz Game that runs entirely inside the browser console, without using any HTML or DOM elements.
The user is asked a series of predefined questions using prompt(), receives instant feedback using alert(), and finally sees their total score.

This assignment demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, string methods, and basic I/O in JavaScript.
(Prepared based on instructions from the provided PDF.)

 Objective

Build a quiz that runs in the browser console.

Ask questions from a predefined array.

Take user answers using prompt().

Show feedback with alert().

Compare input using toLowerCase() and trim().

Track and display the final score.

 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will learn to:

Use core JavaScript concepts: variables, arrays, loops, functions, and conditionals.

Store data (questions and answers) inside objects within an array.

Use for loops to iterate through quiz questions.

Accept user input using prompt() and output results using alert().

Apply string methods like toLowerCase() and trim() for accurate input validation.

Maintain a score counter to track user performance.

Display results effectively in the browser console.

 How the Quiz Works

The quiz loads a list of question–answer pairs.

The function runQuiz() starts the game.

For each question:

User is shown a prompt to type their answer.

Input is normalized (case-insensitive + whitespace removed).

If the answer is correct → Score increases.

Instant feedback is shown.

At the end, the final score is displayed in an alert.

 How to Run the Quiz

Follow these steps:

Open Google Chrome (or any browser).

Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I to open Developer Tools.

Go to the Console tab.

Paste the entire script (quiz.js) into the console.

Press Enter to start the quiz.
